        <h2><div class="description">Description</div></h2>
        <p>Neoguri is primarily known for its seafood instant ramyun, but don't overlook its delicious stir fry noodles!</p>
        <p>If you want a quick warm meal at home without having to prepare a whole feast, look no further than one of Nongshim's best exports. This seafood flavored stir fry pairs well with kimchi - a Korean staple - along with traditional favorites: fried eggs and Spam (or any luncheon meat, really). Readily available at your local Asian grocer.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Neoguri stir fry instant noodles (and contents inside)</li>
        </ul>
