        <h3 class="instructions"><em>Sushi Rice</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse rice to rid of the starch, then add to rice cooker with water and set to cook.</li>
            <li>Once rice is cooked, place rice in mixing bowl and add a teaspoon of sesame oil to taste, gently fold.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle in some furikake rice seasoning, and gently fold the mixture again.</li>
            <li>Deposit rice into an oven-safe casserole dish and spread evenly. Sprinkle a layer of furikake atop the rice and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="instructions"><em>Salmon & Crab Mix</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400F.</li>
            <li>Place salmon on greased baking pan and place in oven once oven is done preheating (temperature should be at 400F). Let bake for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While salmon is baking, start chopping up imitation crab meat into small quarter inch chunks (or run through food processor, if available).</li>
            <li>Once salmon is done baking, place on a plate and start shredding into smaller pieces, then transfer into mixing bowl with the chopped up imitation crab meat.</li>
            <li>In the mixing bowl, add the cream cheese, half a cup of Kewpie mayo, and your desired amount of sriracha to taste. Fold and mix well with the salmon and imitation crab meat.</li>
            <li>Chop up green onions and add to mixing bowl, fold to mix.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="instructions"><em>Sushi Bake</em></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
            <li>Take salmon and crab mixture and spread a thick, even layer atop the sushi rice prepared earlier.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle furikake rice seasoning atop the salmon and crab layer, and, if you so desire, drizzle some Kewpie mayo and sriracha on top for added taste.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes.</li>
